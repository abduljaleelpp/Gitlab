    The `merge_status` field in the [merge request API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#merge-status) has been deprecated in favor of the `detailed_merge_status` field which more correctly identifies all of the potential statuses that a merge request can be in. API users are encouraged to use the new `detailed_merge_status` field instead. The `merge_status` field will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.
