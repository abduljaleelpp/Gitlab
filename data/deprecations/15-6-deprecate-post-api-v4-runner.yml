    The `POST` method operation on the `/api/v4/runners` endpoint is deprecated.
    This endpoint and method [registers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner) a runner
    with a GitLab instance at the instance, group, or project level through the API. We plan to remove this endpoint
    and method in GitLab 16.0.

    In GitLab 15.8, we plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance,
    as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/).
    This new architecture introduces a new method for registering runners and will eliminate the legacy
    [runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-registration-tokens).
    From GitLab 16.0 and later, the runner registration methods implemented by the new GitLab Runner token architecture will be the only supported methods.
