    The command to [register](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) a runner, `gitlab-runner register` is deprecated.
    GitLab plans to introduce a new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/) in GitLab 15.8,
    which introduces a new method for registering runners and eliminates the legacy
    [runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-registration-tokens).
    The new method will involve passing a [runner authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-authentication-tokens-also-called-runner-tokens)
    to a new `gitlab-runner deploy` command.
